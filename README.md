## Java practice

This is a repository for my solutions to practical tasks from Epam Java self-paced course.

There are tasks on following topics: 

- Java Core(including collections, logging, IO, etc)
- JDBC
- Java EE
- JUnit 
- Java Concurrency
- Spring Framework
- Spring MVC
- Spring Boot

There is another readme.md in each project in this repository.
